# Copy Link With Click (Firefox addon)

Copy a link to your clipboard with Alt/Ctrl/Shift-Click.

Defaults to using the Alt key, but you can change it to Control or Shift.

## Description

If you  install this addon, Alt (by default) Clicking on a link will copy its href attribute. It'll use the closest anchor it can find ([closest in the jQuery sense](https://api.jquery.com/closest/#closest-selector)).
